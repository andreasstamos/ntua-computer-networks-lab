# Computer Networks - 8th Semester - ECE NTUA

This repository contains the reports for the exercises of the course **Computer Networks Laboratory - 8th Semester - ECE NTUA**.

## Description

The exercises focus on setting up various practical network topologies to study typical cases of LAN interconnection (switching), static and dynamic routing, and key features of routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF, and BGP. Additionally, the exercises cover dynamic IP addressing using DHCP, firewalls, and NAT. The exercises also explore the peculiarities of the IPv6 protocol, its interoperability with IPv4, and the operation of the Domain Name System (DNS).

## Setup

The network topologies are implemented using virtual machines on VirtualBox, with each VM running FreeBSD as the operating system.

- **Free Range Routing (FRR):** Used to implement dynamic routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF, and BGP.
- **IPFW:** The native FreeBSD firewall, utilized for firewall management and Network Address Translation (NAT).
- **FreeBSD Native Network Stack:** Leveraged for LAN interconnections, including switching, VLANs, and other related configurations.
- **Other Tools:** Additional tools were used to support various aspects of the network setup.
